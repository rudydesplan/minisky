# Changelog

All notable changes to the MiniSky project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Native DuckDB Releases**: Added CGO-enabled BigQuery SQL execution for Linux amd64/arm64, macOS arm64, and Windows amd64.
- **BigQuery Conformance Suite**: Added coverage for queries, nested DDL, streaming inserts, file loads, persistence, and no-CGO platform behavior.
- **Platform Diagnostics**: Added `minisky doctor bigquery` to verify DuckDB capability without starting Docker-backed services.
- **Native Release CI**: Added native platform gates, Windows UCRT dependency auditing, checksummed release assembly, and installed-artifact smoke tests.

### Changed
- **Release Packaging**: Native runners now build and verify their platform artifacts before GitHub release publication.
- **Installer Security**: Release archives are checksum-verified before extraction and installation.
- **Docker Runtime**: Linux images now build DuckDB explicitly with CGO and run on a glibc-based distroless image.

### Fixed
- **BigQuery Persistence**: Streaming inserts now persist to DuckDB using parameterized transactions.
- **Nested BigQuery Schemas**: RECORD/STRUCT and REPEATED fields now produce valid DuckDB types.
- **DuckDB Lifecycle**: Custom database paths, connection cleanup, and no-CGO errors are handled consistently.
- **Repository Quality**: Added CI, characterization tests, strict UI linting, reproducible builds, and corrected documentation/configuration drift.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **macOS arm64 Build**: Added `darwin/arm64` target to the release pipeline, producing a native Apple Silicon binary (`minisky_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`) for the first time. Installer script now validates the asset exists in the release before downloading, preventing silent 404 failures.
- **Improved Installer Robustness**: Switched `curl` to `--fail` mode (`-fsSL`) so HTTP errors abort cleanly. Asset URL is now resolved from the GitHub Releases API manifest instead of being blindly constructed.
- **Docker Socket Detection (macOS)**: Added `~/.docker/run/docker.sock` as a candidate path in the Docker socket resolver, matching Docker Desktop ≥ 4.13 on macOS.
- **Platform Roadmap**: Added a `Platform Roadmap — DuckDB / CGO` section to the README documenting the planned path to full BigQuery DuckDB emulation on macOS arm64 and Windows native.

### Changed
- **macOS BigQuery**: The `darwin/arm64` binary is built with `CGO_ENABLED=0` for this release. BigQuery SQL execution falls back to the in-memory mock (same behaviour as Windows). All other GCP services are fully functional. Full DuckDB support on macOS is tracked on the roadmap.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Global Uninstall Command**: Added an `uninstall` CLI command (`minisky uninstall`) to gracefully stop the daemon, prune all `minisky-*` Docker containers/networks, and delete the data directory.
- **Centralized Data Storage**: Moved the `.minisky` state directory from the local working directory to the global user home directory (e.g., `~/.minisky` or `C:\Users\Username\.minisky`). Includes an automatic, zero-data-loss migration for legacy local directories on startup.

### Fixed
- **Missing Dropdown Options**: Embedded `images.json` configuration directly into the compiled Go binary using `//go:embed` to resolve an issue where Compute and Dataproc dropdown menus were empty on Windows deployments.
- **Container Volume Failures on Windows**: Refactored Docker volume binding logic in the Orchestrator to correctly parse absolute Windows host paths (e.g., `C:\path`), preventing container initialization failures.
- **BigQuery CSV Uploads on Windows**: Sanitized local file paths before SQL injection (converting backslashes to forward slashes) to prevent DuckDB from evaluating Windows paths as invalid SQL escape sequences.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Artifact Registry**: New native Go shim and management drawer.
  - Support for repository creation and listing.
  - Integrated with local `registry:2` Docker container.
  - Multi-project isolation support.
- **Cloud Build**: Enhanced GitHub source support with workspace volume mapping.
- **Secret Manager**: Native Go-based implementation with multi-versioning.
- **Cloud Tasks**: Native Go-based implementation with queue management.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Cloud KMS Shim**: Fully native Go-based implementation using AES-256-GCM. Supports Key Ring and Crypto Key management, key version creation, key rotation, and version destruction. Full encrypt/decrypt operations via the REST API and UI Dashboard.
- **Cloud Build Shim**: Native implementation supporting the `cloudbuild.googleapis.com` API. Features include asynchronous build execution, multi-step pipeline orchestration using transient Docker containers, and a specialized UI drawer for build submission and history tracking.

### Fixed
- **Memorystore Container Provisioning**: Fixed a critical bug where Memorystore instances were failing to provision due to an invalid JSON payload sent to the Docker API. 
- **Memorystore Dynamic Ports**: Updated the Orchestrator to support dynamic port bindings, allowing multiple Redis/Memcached instances to run without host port conflicts. The correctly assigned port is now reflected in the dashboard UI.

- **Native Windows Support**: Implemented cross-platform Docker socket resolution to support Windows Named Pipes (`//./pipe/docker_engine`).
- **New Visual Identity**: Integrated the official MiniSky favicon across the web landing page and embedded dashboard.
- **Improved Documentation**: 
    - Added a Prerequisites section (Docker, Git) to README and website.
    - Added detailed Windows installation instructions for Scoop.
    - Updated website with authentic high-fidelity dashboard screenshots.
- **Enhanced Release Pipeline**: Upgraded `release.sh` to automatically clean up remote tags/releases and push local commits before deployment.

### Fixed
- Resolved `dial unix /var/run/docker.sock` error on Windows machines.
- Fixed UI asset embedding to ensure the new favicon is included in the single binary release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Initial Release**: Core MiniSky emulator with support for 16+ GCP service shims.
- **Embedded Console**: Premium React-based dashboard for observability and resource management.
- **Terraform Integration**: Custom endpoint routing support for the official Google Cloud provider.
- **Lazy Loading**: Sub-100ms service startup times via Go-based lazy initialization.
- **Single Binary**: Fully self-contained architecture for maximum portability.
